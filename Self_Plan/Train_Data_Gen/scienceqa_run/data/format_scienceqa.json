One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",

He read that using a heating pad to heat up potting soil could help make seeds germinate, or sprout, faster. Kenneth wondered whether the temperature of the heating pad would affect how quickly the seeds germinated.\nKenneth prepared two potting trays, each made up of ten small pots of soil. He planted one cucumber seed in each small pot and arranged the potting trays near a sunny window. He set an electric heating pad to 75°F and placed it under one potting tray. He set a second heating pad to 85°F and placed it under the other potting tray. Kenneth observed the pots daily, and he counted the number of days it took until a seed germinated in each pot.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCooper was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Cooper thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.\nFigure: studying an architect's design.\nOptions: (A) if at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees in each design (B) which design would have the least traffic noise in the concert area (C) which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road",

But sometimes, disease or injury can cause damage that is too severe to heal. When a limb is too severely damaged to heal, it may need to be amputated, or removed.\nFor example, a doctor can treat an infected limb with medicine. But if the infection does not go away, it can spread to the rest of the person's body. To stop the infection from spreading, the infected limb may need to be amputated.\nIn other cases, when a limb is badly injured, the skin, bones, muscles, and nerves may be severely damaged. If the damaged tissue cannot heal, it may die. The severely damaged or dead tissue then needs to be amputated.\nOptions: (A) After an accident, the limb is too badly injured to heal.

But if the infection does not go away, it can spread to the rest of the person's body. To stop the infection from spreading, the infected limb may need to be amputated.\nIn other cases, when a limb is badly injured, the skin, bones, muscles, and nerves may be severely damaged.

Then answer the question.\n\nWhite sea urchins live in tropical oceans. Sea urchins are covered with hard, sharp spines. These spear-like spines protect the sea urchin from predators, such as fish. Sometimes a small worm, called a bristle worm, also uses the spines for protection.\nThe worm lives on the sea urchin, between the spines. To attack a worm on the sea urchin's body, a fish would have to get past the spines. When the worm lives on the sea urchin, the worm does not change the sea urchin's ability to survive.\nFigure: a white sea urchin in the ocean.\nOptions: (A) mutualistic (B) commensal (C) parasitic",

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCharlotte was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Charlotte wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash.

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nBarbara glued lids onto 16 cardboard shoe boxes of equal size. She painted eight of the boxes black and eight of the boxes white. Barbara made a small hole in the side of each box and then stuck a thermometer partially into each hole so she could measure the temperatures inside the boxes. She placed the boxes in direct sunlight in her backyard. Two hours later, she measured the temperature inside each box. Barbara compared the average temperature inside the black boxes to the average temperature inside the white boxes.\nFigure: a shoebox painted black.\nOptions: (A) Do the temperatures inside boxes depend on the sizes of the boxes? (B) Do the insides of white boxes get hotter than the insides of black boxes when the boxes are left in the sun?",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",

Jellyfish and sea anemone, for example, are both part of the phylum Cnidaria. Cnidaria comes from a Greek word that means \"nettle,\" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean.\nAnother phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins. Unlike a cnidarian's wavy tentacles, these spines are used for protection, not to capture prey.\nOptions: (A) echinoderm (B) cnidarian",

As the crew waited to have breakfast, a strong smell of sulfur drifted over the boat. At first, crew members thought that the cook had burned the eggs or that something was wrong with the boat's engine. But when the sun started to rise, the crew saw black smoke billowing from the water a few kilometers away.\nThe captain of the Isleifur II first thought the smoke was coming from a boat that was on fire, so he sailed closer to try to help. But as the Isleifur II approached the column of smoke, the captain and crew saw glowing pieces of molten rock shooting up out of the water. The captain realized this was not a burning boat. It was a volcano erupting under the water!\nFigure: the erupting undersea volcano seen by the sailors on the Isleifur II.\nOptions: (A) He heard a report on the radio warning about a volcanic eruption.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCarter was installing solar panels on the roof of a client's house. The panels had to provide enough electricity to power the house year-round. Carter needed to decide how many panels to install and which side of the roof to install them on. If he put the panels on the side that got the most sun, then he could use fewer panels, and the client would save money. Carter installed sunlight sensors on both sides of the roof. Then, he measured the amount of sunlight the sensors on each side of the roof recorded over one sunny summer day.\nFigure: installing solar panels on a roof.\nOptions: (A) the amount of sunlight the roof would get throughout the year (B) how many solar panels could fit on each side of the roof (C) which side of the roof got more sun over one day",

A common metaphor used to illustrate the difference between these terms is a bull's-eye, or target. Darts thrown accurately at a bull's-eye all hit close to the center of the target but not necessarily close to each other. Darts thrown precisely at a bull's-eye, by contrast, all hit the same spot but not necessarily at the center of the bull's-eye.\nOptions: (A) accuracy (B) precision",

He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.\nOptions: (A) how much athletes would sweat in the fabric (B) how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water (C) if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nErnest was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour",

        "Question": "Which term matches the picture?\nContext: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\nOptions: (A) operant conditioning (B) classical conditioning",

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nShelley was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Shelley wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash.

        "Question": "Based on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?\nContext: Read the text about cats.\nCats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!\nOptions: (A) The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses. (B) The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers. (C) The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice. (D) The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.",

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nHayley was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Hayley wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash.

Its chemical structure depends on the number and types of atoms in each of its molecules, as well as on how those atoms are arranged.\nOne property of a substance is its flavor, which is its odor and taste combined. The chemical structure of a substance determines both the kind of flavor it has and the strength of that flavor.\nSyrups containing flavorants are used to add flavor to snow cones.\nSubstances that have especially interesting and strong flavors are often added to food to change or enhance the food's flavor. These substances are called flavorants. Flavorants can be found in nature, made in a chemical factory, or both.\nOne example of a flavorant is methyl anthranilate. This flavorant is often used to add a grape flavor to syrups, candy, and other sweets. Methyl anthranilate is found naturally in certain types of grapes, but it can also be made by workers in a chemical factory.\nOptions: (A) A flavorant might be both found in nature and made in a chemical factory.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nSebastian was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Sebastian put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nMason was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Mason put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",

To reach the nectar, a moth puts its long, tubular mouthpart, called a proboscis, inside a flower. While the moth drinks nectar, pollen from the flower sticks to the moth's head and proboscis.\nLater, the moth visits another petunia flower to drink more nectar. When pollen on the moth's head and proboscis is transferred to the female part of the other flower, that flower is pollinated.

Thousands of Americans and Vietnamese had died in the war, giving rise to a growing anti-war movement. President Johnson, a Democrat, declined to run for reelection, in part because of the heavy opposition to his conduct of the war. Just months before the convention, both Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, contributing to widespread unrest. Anti-war protesters wanted the Democratic Party to oppose the war, but they were excluded from the convention. This set off violent clashes between police and protesters on Chicago streets. The violence at the convention captured the nation's attention, strengthened the peace movement, and led to reforms in the nominating process.\nOptions: (A) cause-effect (B) compare-contrast",

Giant tortoises can live up to a year without food or water if they have to!\nLife has not always been easy for giant tortoises, though. When people first arrived at the Galápagos Islands hundreds of years ago, they took many of the tortoises away. And some people hunted the tortoises for food and oil. Few tortoises are left on the island today. Luckily, many groups of people are now working to keep these giant animals safe. Hopefully, giant tortoises can roam the islands for many years to come.\nOptions: (A) when there is not much water (B) when the tortoise is growing quickly (C) when it is cold outside",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nKaty and Anne were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test.\nOptions: (A) if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use (B) if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry",

In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait.\nIn a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants.\nOptions: (A) 4:0 (B) 3:1 (C) 1:3 (D) 0:4 (E) 2:2",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nKenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",

        "Question": "Based on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals?\nContext: Read the text about bats.\nSeveral kinds of animals \"talk\" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals. (B) They can communicate about specific problems. (C) They can understand some human speech.",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDuncan was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nManny was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Manny put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nWind turbines use wind power to produce electricity. Akira was a materials engineer who designed wind turbines. She wanted to design a new turbine that would produce 10% more electricity than older wind turbines. She thought that a turbine made from lightweight material would turn more easily and produce more electricity. So, Akira created a computer model of a turbine made from lightweight material. Then she used the model to calculate how much more electricity the new turbine could produce compared to the older turbines.\nFigure: studying a wind turbine computer model.\nOptions: (A) how much the new turbine would weigh (B) whether the new turbine could produce 10% more electricity (C) if the new turbine could turn easily",

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nKenny was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Kenny thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.\nFigure: studying an architect's design.\nOptions: (A) if at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees in each design (B) which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road (C) which design would have the least traffic noise in the concert area",
